        <li>4 chicken breasts</li>

<p>For the the burgers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 sesame seed burger buns</li>
        <li>Handful lettuce leave</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes (sliced)</li>
        <li>Sauce of choice</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, preheat your oven to 180°C</li>
        <li>Then place the tortilla crisps, chilli powder, garlic granules, and paprika in a zip-lock food bag and use a rolling pin to smash the mixture into fine crumbs.</li>
        <li>Next, set up a station to prepare your chicken breasts — you should line up three shallow bowls or slightly rounded plates. In the first, you should have cornflour, in the second you should have the beaten egg, and you should empty out the tortilla mix into the third.</li>
        <li>Prepare your chicken breasts by patting them dry with a piece of kitchen towel. Then use tongs to place the first one in the cornflour mix – making sure to cover it fully. Then move on to dip the coated chicken breast into the egg wash, then finally the spicy tortilla mix. Repeat for the remaining chicken breasts.</li>
        <li>Place each coated chicken breast on a baking tray and a spray with low-calorie cooking spray. Bake for 25 minutes, then carefully remove the tray from the oven and turn each chicken breast over. Spray the other side of each one with some more low-calorie spray and then bake for a further 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare your burger buns by cutting them in half. Add a generous amount of peri peri sauce to the bottom bun, then place a few salad leaves and slices of tomato on top.</li>
        <li>Once the zingy chicken fillets are completely cooked through and golden, place them on top of the tomatoes and lettuce. Then add another squirt of peri peri sauce or low-sugar ketchup and complete the burger with the top of the bun.</li>
    </ol>
